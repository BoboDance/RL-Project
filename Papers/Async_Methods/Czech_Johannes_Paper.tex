        This paper aims to address the issue of often high computational requirements for Reinforcement Learning application by validating techniques introduced by asynchronous methods.
        First go over the general principle and the motivation behind asynchronous methods. Brief history when asynchronous where used for RL the first time. Next cover the theory of techniques of shared weight updates.Taking technical challenges into account such as process communication and memory requirements.  Description and discussion of the superlinearity phenomena when using asynchronous methods. Discuss application areas for asynchronous methods and advantages and potential problems when using them.

Introduction


Try to give proof for this phenomena otherwise rely on empirical experiments





    \section{Introduction}
    \label{intro}
    From a historical perspective asynchronous have appeared very early in the research. One of the earliest use cases of asynchronous methods for RL was in the context of Dynamic Programming with a technique called Prioritized Sweeping -> Reference.
    \textit{-> shortly go over Dynamic Programming}
